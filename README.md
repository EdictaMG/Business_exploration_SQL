# Using SQL to explore a business

## Summary
In this repository I use SQL to explore data provided for a project on a fictive business in Brazil, "Magist", to evaluate whether or not another fictive Europe-based IT company, "Eniac", should partner for expanding its business overseas. A final recommendation is made to not partner with Magist given its declining performance, concerns about its scalability, differing market profiles, and risks, including unknowns. 

## Files
- **Magist_business_exploration**: SQL query exploring Magist data files
- **Magist_schema:** schema of Magist's tables
- **Presentation**: slides used for a 5 minute presentation on the position against a partnerships

## Languages
SQL

## Tools
MySQLWorkbench (for analysing with SQL)
Tableau Public (for creating graph in presentation)
