# Using SQL to explore a business

## Summary
In this repository I use SQL to explore data provided for a project on a fictive business in Brazil, "Magist", to evaluate whether or not another fictive Europe-based IT company, "Eniac", should partner for expanding its business overseas. I make the final recommendation to not partner with Magist. Slides used for a 5 minute presentation on the position is also shared here.

## Languages
SQL

## Tools
MySQLWorkbench

## Key Learnings
As a beginner in Python (and in coding), two key learnings acquired during the process of scripting this calculator were internalizing the importance of 1) being clear of what I actually wanted to accomplish (what would my end goal should look like) and 2) understanding the actual scripting (what does the syntax really mean)?
