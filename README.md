# Using SQL to explore a business

## Summary
In this repository I use SQL to explore data provided for a project on a fictive business in Brazil, "Magist", to evaluate whether or not another fictive Europe-based IT company, "Eniac", should partner for expanding its business overseas. I make the final recommendation to not partner with Magist given its declining performance, concerns about its scalability, differing market profiles, and risks, including unknowns.
